# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the School District Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to get a more accurate evaluation of the school district grades and spending per school. The data was previously skewed by compromised grades from Thomas high school ninth graders. Thomas High School ninth grade reading and math scores were replaced by NaNs so that the rest of the data would not be affected by the change in the value of the scores. This gave us a more accurate look at School District grades and spending.
### How is the district summary affected?
When the 9th grade student Math and Reading scores from Thomas High School were excluded from the District Summary, there was a slight adjustment to the Average Math Score, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and % Overall Passing.
